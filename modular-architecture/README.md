# Modular Architecture & Lazy Loading

This series presents a **graph-based approach** to front-end architecture.

It explains how to:
- structure modules with clear dependency boundaries,
- avoid circular dependencies by design,
- design lazy loading as *lazy subgraphs* with explicit UX state machines.

The goal is to reason about large front-end systems through **dependency graphs, lazy expansion, and runtime loading strategies**.
